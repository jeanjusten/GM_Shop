# :computer: Landing Page - GM! Games (Non-responsive)
  <p>
  This is the first Landing Page i developed. It was part of a project for EBAC (Escola Brit√¢nica de Artes Criativas e Tecnologia).<br>
  It was a very fun project, using only HTML and CSS, and i could learn a lot just by messing up with the hover selector.

<p>
  This awesome ''lighting up" effect was done with <strong>hover</strong> selector only.
  The effect is achieved by overlaping two images (in this case, i used the same dimensions for them, to make it easier): 
<li>The Block with branches</li> 
<li>The glowing leaves</li> <br>
  Then i applied a 100% grayscale filter on the leaves, tooking off the filter upon hovering the mouse on it. 
  To smooth things out, i added a 0.5s ease-in-out transition on the filter.
